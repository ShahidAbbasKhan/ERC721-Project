# ERC721 Project 
## Contract Address Deployed on Goerli: https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x2E5556C604f6b550B5b5e42735Cb14366CE8a866

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
